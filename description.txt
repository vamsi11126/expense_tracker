Project Title
Personal Expense Tracker (Web App)

Description
This is a browser-based expense management tool that helps users track their income, expenses, and balance in real-time.
It stores all data locally using the browser’s localStorage, so the information persists even after refreshing or closing the browser.

The app allows users to:

Add transactions with a description, amount, and type (income or expense).

Validate inputs (description must be text, amount must be numeric).

View a transaction history list.

Automatically calculate total income, total expenses, and current balance.

Show a Low Balance warning if expenses exceed income.

Features
Add New Transactions

Input description, amount, and type (radio buttons for income/expense).

Validation ensures description contains only letters and spaces.

Amounts are stored as numbers for calculation.

Persistent Storage

Transactions are saved in localStorage so they remain after reload.

Totals for income and expense are updated instantly.

Balance = Income − Expense.
