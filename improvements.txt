1. Better User Experience (UX)
Delete transactions → Add a ❌ button for each list item so users can remove mistakes.

Edit transactions → Allow clicking an entry to modify description/amount/type.

Clear all transactions → One button to reset everything.

2. UI Improvements
Color coding:

Income = green

Expense = red

Highlight low balance (you already have text, but you can also change the background or shake the card).

Sort transactions → Latest first, or group income/expenses separately.

3. Data & Insights
Date & time → Store a timestamp with each transaction and display it.

Monthly summary → Filter and calculate totals for the current month.

Charts → Use a library like Chart.js to show income vs expense visually (pie chart or bar chart).

4. Extra Features
Search/filter transactions by keyword or type.

Export data → Download transactions as CSV or JSON.

Import data → Allow uploading a JSON backup to restore transactions.

Dark mode → Toggle between light and dark themes (save preference in localStorage).

5. Advanced Ideas
Recurring transactions (like monthly rent/salary).

Budget goals → Set a monthly spending limit and warn if exceeded.

Category system (Food, Transport, Rent, etc.) and show category-wise spending chart
